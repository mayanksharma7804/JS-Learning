JavaScript Execution Context

Types :
1. Global Execution Context
2. Function Execution Context
3. Eval Execution Context

phases :
1. memory creation phase : memory being allocated
varibles are collected and undefined is put inside them.
2. Execution phase : addition, sub etc whatever

JS CODE :
val1 = 12;
val2 = 4;
function addition(n1, n2) {
  let sum = n1 + n2;
  return sum;
}
let result1 = addition(val1, val2);
let result2 = addition(5, 9);
console.log(`Result is : ${result1}`);

1. Global Execution Phase
this

2. Memory Phase : 
val1 : undefined
val2 : undefined
addnum : definition
result1 : undefined
result2 : undefined

3. Execution Phase : 
val1 <-- 12
val2 <-- 4
addnum --> new variable environment + Execution phase
